See comments in shinyFromGIT.R for instructions on launching this tool.

There are various options that are given in the file.  How you launch the tool will depend on your operating system and the default browser.

Novices:  When you are finished with the tool, closing the browser window won't return control of your R session.  You will need to stop R from waiting on the tool.  In Rstudio (highly recommended), that means clicking the stopsign symbol in the console window, or from the menu do Session>>>Interrupt R.  If you happen to be trying this from a terminal window or Rgui, a Ctrl-C or Esc will probably return control.
